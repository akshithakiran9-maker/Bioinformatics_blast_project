functional Annotation:
SAMHD1 is a deoxynucloeside triphosphate triphosphohydrolase involved in regulating 
intracellular dNTP levels and innate immune response.
It restricts viral relication during the early stages of infection.
Does by lowering intracellular dNTPlevels,thereby inhinbiting viral dna synthesis.
this antivairal activity has been observed in dendritic cells,macgrophages,and 
certain melanoma cells.
